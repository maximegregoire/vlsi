09/22/2008 Updated DE2_TOP.vhd to correct the TD_DATA port declaration.

-----------
This is a base project for the Altera DE2 board. You can use it to get started on your project.

For some reason, Quartus doesn't like it when you try to compile things on the desktop, so I suggest *temporarily* copying your project on the C drive when you are working in Quartus (its also much faster than working off a network drive).

There are more references and information available on the Demo CD, however they are all in Verilog.

Good luck!
